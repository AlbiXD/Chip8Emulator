<h1>CHIP 8 Emulator</h1>
<a>This is my current journey into emulating, I decided to make this little project to get a deeper understanding of how a computer would work</a>
<a>at the lower levels. My goals for this project is to get a fully working emulator to look similar to the image below</a>

<h2>What Is Chip-8?</h2>
<a>Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language and virtual machine created in the 1970s for programming video games. It was designed for the RCA COSMAC VIP computer and is quite a popular as a learning tool for emulation and low-level programming.</a>
